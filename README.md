# Monoflex keyboard

This repo contains case, plate, foam and PCB  design files for a Monoflex keyboard.

Case, plates and foam designed by me ([Bizunow](https://github.com/Bizunow)) and PCB designed by [keyten](https://github.com/KeyTen1).

Maintained by [Bizunow](https://github.com/Bizunow) & [ILWrites](https://github.com/pikeeb)

Huge thanks to all, who helped me design this keyboard.
